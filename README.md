# This modpack is built to make Minecraft feel alive.
From fluid player movement and detailed animations to immersive combat and responsive environments, Just Another Action Mix (JAAM) transforms the game into a dynamic experience. The goal is simple: remove the stiffness, amplify the energy, and create a world that feels reactive, engaging, and full of motion. For details, an Emotecraft tutorial, list of mods, and an installation guide, go to [JAAM's wiki.](https://github.com/micahnw/JAAM/wiki)
